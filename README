----- NIVEUSLUNA'S FORK README -----

This is an attempt to make WebPG for Firefox work on SeaMonkey. Hasn't been tested yet. Needs to be rebuilt.

install.rdf has been modified from upstream to make SeaMonkey API versions match up with the listed Firefox and Thunderbird versions.

----- and now back to your regularly scheduled upstream README -----

WebPG provides GnuPG, GPG, PGP related Public/Private Key operations and management in Mozilla Firefox

Features as of Version 0.8.3 -

* Fully functioning Public/Private Key manager
* Inline parsing of PGP blocks and keys
* Right-click to Verify, Sign, Encrypt and Decrypt
* Rough gmail integration [EXPERIMENTAL]

In order for this to operate you *must* have some software installed depending on your operating system; namely, GnuPG and a key agent.

Keep in mind, this is beta software, it will probably have lots of bugs -- use at your own risk, and please inform me of any bugs/issues via webpg-bugs@curetheitch.com

To build the extension [Linux or OSX], clone or download this repository, and from the root directory execute:

```
./config_build.sh
./build.sh
```

This should create the XPI file and load the extension in Firefox for installation.
